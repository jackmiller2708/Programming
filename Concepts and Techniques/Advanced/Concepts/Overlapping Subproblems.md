A problem is said to have **overlapping subproblems** if the problem can be broken down into subproblems which are reused several times or a [[Recursion|recursive algorithm]] for the problem solves the same subproblem over and over rather than always generating new subproblems. In other words, **when solutions to the same subproblems are needed again and again**.
