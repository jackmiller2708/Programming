Objects OOP languages can be compared to objects in real life. An object is a standalone entity, with properties and type. Compare it with a cup, for example. A cup is an object, with properties. A cup has a color, a design, weight, a material it is made of, etc. The same way, OOP objects can have properties, which define their characteristics.

When we refer to an object, we use object references, which basically a pointer to the actual location of the object in memory.

When working with objects, we don't actually work directly with them but rather a reference to such objects.
