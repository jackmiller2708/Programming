## In the context of Dynamic Programming
Tabulation is a **bottom-up** approach where we store the results of the subproblems in a table and use these results to solve larger subproblems until we solve the entire problem. It is used when we can define the problem as a sequence of subproblems and the <u>**subproblems do not overlap**</u>. Tabulation is typically implemented using **iteration** and is well-suited for problems that have a large set of inputs.
