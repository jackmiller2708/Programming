Server-Side Rendering (SSR) is a technique for rendering web pages on the server each time a request is received. This means that:
- the server has to process the page's content and generate the HTML before it can be sent to the user. 
- This can make SSR pages slower to load than static pages, but it allows for more dynamic content.
