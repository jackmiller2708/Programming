Static site generation is a technique for generating static HTML pages at build time. This means that:
- the pages are created **once and then served** to users without any further processing,
- makes static sites <u>very fast to load</u>, even for users with slow internet connections. 

> [!Note]
> However, static sites cannot be updated dynamically, so they are not suitable for websites that need to display frequently changing content.
