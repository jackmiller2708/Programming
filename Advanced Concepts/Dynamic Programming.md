Dynamic programming is a technique where an algorithmic problem is first broken down into sub-problems, the results are saved so the same problem will not have to be computed again, and then the sub-problems are optimized to find the overall solution â€” which usually has to do with finding the maximum and minimum range of the algorithmic query.  

## Characteristics of Dynamic Programming Algorithm
- The given problem can be broken up into smaller sub-problems, and these smaller subproblems can be divided into still smaller ones, and in this process, you see some overlapping subproblems.
- The solution to the problem can be constructed from the solutions to the subproblems.
- The optimal solutions to the subproblems contribute to the optimal solution of the given problem (referred to as the [[Optimal Structure|Optimal Substructure Property]]).
