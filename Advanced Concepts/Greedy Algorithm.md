A greedy algorithm is an algorithmic [[Programming Paradigms|paradigm]] that follows the problem-solving heuristic of making the locally optimal choice at each stage with the hope of finding a global optimum. In other words, a greedy algorithm chooses the best possible option at each step, without considering the consequences of that choice on future steps.

The greedy algorithm is useful when a problem can be divided into smaller subproblems and the solution of each subproblem can be combined to solve the overall problem. The greedy algorithm can be used to solve optimization problems that involve finding the best solution among many possible solutions.

It is important to prove the correctness of a greedy algorithm and to understand its limitations. The greedy algorithm can be applied in many contexts, including scheduling, graph theory, and [[Dynamic Programming|dynamic programming]].

Greedy Algorithm is defined as a method for solving optimization problems by taking decisions that result in the most evident and immediate benefit irrespective of the final outcome. It works for cases where **minimization** or **maximization** leads to the required solution.
