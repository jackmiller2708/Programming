Some people say that OOP tries to model the real world. This is simply not true — OOP has nothing to relate to in the real world. Trying to model programs as objects probably is one of the biggest OOP mistakes.

## The real world is not hierarchical

OOP attempts to model everything as a hierarchy of objects. Unfortunately, that is not how things work in the real world. Objects in the real world interact with each other using messages, but they mostly are independent of each other.

## Inheritance in the real world

OOP inheritance is not modeled after the real world. The parent object in the real world is unable to change the behavior of child objects at run-time. Even though you inherit your DNA from your parents, they’re unable to make changes to your DNA as they please. You do not inherit “behaviors” from your parents, you develop your own behaviors. And you’re unable to “override” your parents’ behaviors.

## The real world has no methods

Does the piece of paper you’re writing on have a “write” _method_? No! You take an empty piece of paper, pick up a pen, and write some text. You, as a person, don’t have a “write” method either — you make the decision to write some text based on outside events or your internal thoughts.
