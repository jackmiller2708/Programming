Selecting [[Plain Objects|object]] as a universally standardized building block, a programmer prepares a base class that contains member values and functions, and in order to obtain variations of the blocks, inheritance is used.

OOP idea is often explained by using real-world physical objects, and the paradigm itself is weak on mathematical abstraction.

For instance, functions(or methods) are subordinate to objects, and functions are not required to be a first-class object, and this is as a matter of course since the paradigm originally selected object as their well-designed universally standardized building block.

The perspective of where functions are subordinate entities to objects as the standardized building block and both roles are strictly different comes from an engineering sense in the physical world. not the mathematical abstraction where programming actually resides.

The fundamental problem of OOP is simply that object turns out to be not the well-designed universally standardized building block. Functional programming or monad are the better alternatives with the strong mathematical background.
