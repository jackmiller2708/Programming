The answer is simple, the reptiloid alien race has conspired with the NSA (and the Russians) to torture us programmers to death… But seriously, Java is probably the answer.

## Java was *SIMPLE*

When it was first introduced in 1995, Java was a very simple programming language, compared to the alternatives. At that time, the barrier of entry for writing desktop applications was high. Developing desktop applications involved writing low-level win32 APIs in C, and developers also had to concern themselves with manual memory management. The other alternative was Visual Basic, but many probably didn’t want to lock themselves into the Microsoft ecosystem.

When Java was introduced, it was a no-brainer for many developers since it was free, and could be used across all platforms. Things like built-in garbage collection, friendly-named APIs (compared to the cryptic win32 APIs), proper namespaces, and familiar C-like syntax made Java even more approachable.

GUI programming was also becoming more popular, and it seemed that various UI components mapped well to classes. Method autocompletion in the IDEs also made people claim that OOP APIs are easier to use.

Perhaps Java wouldn’t have been so bad had it not forced OOP on developers. Everything else about Java seemed pretty good. Its garbage collection, portability, exception handling features, which other mainstream programming languages lacked, were really great in 1995,

## Then C# came along

Initially, Microsoft had been relying heavily on Java. When things started getting awry (and after a long legal battle with Sun Microsystems over Java licensing), Microsoft decided to invest in its own version of Java. That is when **C# 1.0** was born. C# as a language has always been thought of as “the better Java”. However, there’s one huge problem — it was the same OOP language with the same flaws, hidden under a slightly improved syntax.

Microsoft has been investing heavily in its .NET ecosystem, which also included good developer tooling. For years Visual Studio has probably been one of the best IDEs available. This, in turn, has led to wide-spread adoption of the .NET framework, especially in the enterprise.

More recently Microsoft has been investing heavily in the browser ecosystem, by pushing its TypeScript. TypeScript is great because it can compile pure JavaScript and adds in things like static type checking. What’s not so great about it is it has no proper support for functional constructs — no built-in immutable data structures, no function composition, no proper pattern matching. TypeScript is OOP-first, and mostly is C# for the browser. [Anders Hejlsberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anders_Hejlsberg) was even responsible for the design of both C# and TypeScript.

## Functional languages

Functional languages, on the other hand, have never been backed by someone as big as Microsoft. F# doesn’t count since the investment was minuscule. The development of functional languages is mostly community-driven. This probably explains the differences in popularity between OOP and FP languages.
