- **[[Server-side Rendering|Server-side rendering (SSR)]]** is a technique for rendering web pages on the server each time a request is received. This means that the server has to process the page's content and generate the HTML before it can be sent to the user. This can make SSR pages slower to load than static pages, but it allows for more dynamic content.
- **[[Static Site Generation|Static site generation (SSG)]]** is a technique for generating static HTML pages at build time. This means that the pages are created once and then served to users without any further processing. This makes static sites very fast to load, even for users with slow internet connections. However, static sites cannot be updated dynamically, so they are not suitable for websites that need to display frequently changing content.
- **[[Client-side Rendering|Client-side rendering (CSR)]]** is a technique for rendering web pages in the client's browser. This means that the browser is responsible for loading the page's HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and then rendering the page's content. CSR has a number of benefits over SSR, including faster page loading times and improved interactivity. However, CSR can make the page more complex to develop and can increase the page's size.
- **[[Incremental Static Generation|Incremental static regeneration (ISR)]]** is a technique that can be used to update static sites without having to rebuild the entire site. ISR works by only regenerating the pages that have changed since the last time the site was updated. This can save time and resources, especially for large sites.

The best way to choose which site rendering technique to use depends on the specific needs of the website. Some factors to consider include the type of content that the website will display, the frequency with which the content changes, and the performance requirements of the website.
